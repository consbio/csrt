= Climate-Smart Restoration Tool (CSRT): User Guide

== Introduction

The CSRT calculates and maps seed transfer limits for plant species. This versatile tool uses two types of data input,
empirical trait data from preloaded genecological studies or provisional data from user-defined climate variables, to
construct site-specific seed transfer limits for ecological restoration and planning. The tool is intended to inform
land managers, seed vendors and scientists of seed transfer limits for individual plant taxa. The eight steps described
below will provide guidelines to tailor the tool to your specific restoration needs.
